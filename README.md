# Analysis-of-ML-algorithms-for-accurate-Breast-Cancer-Classification
In this project, seven different Machine Learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Logistic Regression, K-nn, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and also a Neural Network are implemented on a breast cancer dataset, to train and predict the model for cell classification(Malignant and Benign).To avoid overfitting and underfitting, the dataset is divided into n-cross folds(default fold = 5). Accuracy, Area under the curve(AUC) for PR curves and ROC curves are also calculated for every algorithm for each fold and the mean results are compared to see which algorithm performs better.
